    Convert to a system of first-order ODEs
    (in matrix form, if possible):

        \begin{itemize}
        \item
            $y''(t) + y(t) = 0$,
        \item 
            $\sum_{k = 0}^n a_k(t) y^{(k)}(t) = b(t)$,

    Let $A$ be an $n \times n$ real matrix.
    %
    Show that the solutions $x \from \IR \to \IR^n$ 
    to $x'(t) = A x(t)$ form a vector space.
    %
    What is the dimension of that vector space?

    Write $y''(t) + y(t) = 0$, $y(0) = 0$,
    as a first-order system of ODEs in matrix form.
    %
    What are the eigenvalues of that matrix?
    %
    Solve the ODE.

    The singular value decomposition of a real matrix $A$
    is the product $U S V^\top$ 
    with orthogonal $U$ and $V$
    and 
    a diagonal $S$ 
    (with non-negative \emph{singular values} ordered high-to-low).
    %
    %
    How does the matrix 2-norm,
    $
        \norm{ A }_2
        :=
        \sup \{ \norm{ A x }_2 : \norm{x}_2 = 1 \}
    $,
    relate to the singular values?

    Find the 
    trace / determinant / eigenvalues / eigenvectors / $\exp(t A)$ / 2-norm
    of $A$,
    and
    sketch the solutions
    to $x'(t) = A x(t)$
    with the initial value
    $x_1(0) = 1$, $x_2(0) = 0$,
    for
    \begin{align*}
        A = 
        \begin{pmatrix}
            4 & 1 \\ 1 & 3

    If $x_1' = \log(1 - x_2)$ and $x_2' = \log(x_1)$,
    what happens
    for $x_1(0) = 1 + \varepsilon_1$ and $x_2(0) = \varepsilon_2$?

    Compute $\exp(t J)$, $t \in \mathbb{R}$,

    with
