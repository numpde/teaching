    \subsection*{Introduction}
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    
    Consider the differential equation
    $\dot{x}(t) = A \, x(t)$ in $\IR^2$
    with a constant $2 \times 2$ matrix $A$.
    %
    For each point $x = (x_1, x_2)^\top \in \IR^2$,
    the vector $A \, x$ shows the direction of evolution
    starting from that point.
    
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \subsection*{Problems}
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    
    Given the vectorfield $x \mapsto A \, x$,
    suggest a plausible matrix $A$.
