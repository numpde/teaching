Stochastic ordinary differential equations
are typically solved numerically by sampling.


However, the first and second moments
satisfy a deterministic equation of their own.


For the standard examples
with additive (Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process) or
multiplicative (Geometric Brownian motion)
noise
we derive these deterministic equations
in variational form
and
discuss their well-posedness in detail.


Notably,
the equation for second moment in the multiplicative case
is naturally posed on
projective--injective tensor products
as trial--test spaces.


We propose several Petrov--Galerkin discretizations
based on tensor product piecewise polynomials
and analyze their stability and convergence
in the natural norms.
