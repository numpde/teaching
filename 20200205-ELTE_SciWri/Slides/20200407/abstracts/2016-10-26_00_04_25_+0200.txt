\kk{Numerical methods for moments of solutions to stochastic ordinary differential equations
are typically based on sampling}.


However, the first and second moments
satisfy a deterministic equation of their own.


For the standard examples
with additive noise (Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process)
or
multiplicative noise (Geometric Brownian motion)
we derive these deterministic equations
in variational form
and
discuss their well-posedness in detail.


Notably,
the equation for second moment in the multiplicative case
is naturally posed on
projective--injective tensor products
as trial--test spaces.


We propose several Petrov--Galerkin discretizations
based on tensor product piecewise polynomials
and analyze their stability and convergence
in the natural norms.
