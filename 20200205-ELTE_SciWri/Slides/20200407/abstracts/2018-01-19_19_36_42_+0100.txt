	Numerical methods for stochastic partial differential equations
	typically
	estimate moments of the solution
	from sampled paths.


	Instead,
	we shall directly target
	the deterministic equations
	satisfied by the first and second moments, as well as the covariance.



	In the first part, we focus on stochastic ordinary differential equations.


	For the canonical examples
	with additive noise (Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process)
	or
	multiplicative noise (geometric Brownian motion)
	we derive these deterministic equations
	in variational form
	and
	discuss their well-posedness in detail.


	Notably,
	the second moment equation in the multiplicative case
	is naturally posed on
	projective--injective tensor products
	as trial--test spaces.


	We \kk{construct} Petrov--Galerkin discretizations
	based on tensor product piecewise polynomials
	and analyze their stability and convergence
	in these natural norms.



	In the second part,
	we proceed with
	parabolic stochastic partial differential equations
	with affine multiplicative noise.


	We prove well-posedness of the deterministic variational problem
	for the second moment,
	improving an earlier result.


	We then propose conforming \kk{and stable} space-time Petrov--Galerkin discretizations.



    \kk{In both parts, the outcomes are illustrated by numerical examples.
