Numerical methods for stochastic ordinary differential equations
typically
estimate moments of the solution
from sampled paths.


Instead,
in this paper
we directly target
the deterministic equation
satisfied by the first moment \ra{(mean)} and second moment \ra{(autocorrelation)}.


For the canonical examples
with additive noise (Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process)
or
multiplicative noise (geometric Brownian motion)
we derive these deterministic equations
in variational form
and
discuss their well-posedness in detail.


Notably,
the second moment equation in the multiplicative case
is naturally posed on
projective--injective tensor products
as trial--test spaces.


We propose Petrov--Galerkin discretizations
based on tensor product piecewise polynomials
and analyze their stability and convergence
in the natural norms.
