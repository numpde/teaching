	Numerical methods for stochastic partial differential equations
	typically
	estimate moments of the solution
	from sampled paths.


	Instead,
	in this paper
	we directly target
	the deterministic equations
	satisfied by the first and second moments, as well as the covariance.



	First, we focus on stochastic ordinary differential equations.


	Thus,
	for the canonical examples
	with additive noise (Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process)
	or
	multiplicative noise (geometric Brownian motion)
	we derive these deterministic equations
	in variational form
	and
	discuss their well-posedness in detail.


	Notably,
	the second moment equation in the multiplicative case
	is naturally posed on
	projective--injective tensor products
	as trial--test spaces.


	We propose Petrov--Galerkin discretizations
	based on tensor product piecewise polynomials
	and analyze their stability and convergence
	in these natural norms.

		Second, we explain how
		these ideas can be adapted
		for the numerical computation
		of second moments of stochastic
		partial differential equations
		with affine multiplicative noise.


		Well-posedness of the variational problem
		for the second moment is proven and a
		space-time Petrov--Galerkin discretization is proposed.


		We derive stability for both, the
		continuous and the discrete setting.
