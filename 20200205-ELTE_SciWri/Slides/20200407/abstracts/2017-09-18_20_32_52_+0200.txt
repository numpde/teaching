Numerical methods for stochastic \ra{partial} differential equations
typically
estimate moments of the solution
from sampled paths.


Instead,
in this paper
we directly target
the deterministic equations
satisfied by the first and second moments, as well as the covariance.



\ra{%
First, we focus on stochastic ordinary differential equations.


Thus,
}%
for the canonical examples
with additive noise (Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process)
or
multiplicative noise (geometric Brownian motion)
we derive these deterministic equations
in variational form
and
discuss their well-posedness in detail.


Notably,
the second moment equation in the multiplicative case
is naturally posed on
projective--injective tensor products
as trial--test spaces.


We propose Petrov--Galerkin discretizations
based on tensor product piecewise polynomials
and analyze their stability and convergence
in \ra{these} natural norms.



\ra{%
Second, we explain how
the computation of the second moment
of stochastic partial differential equations
can be reduced to
a system of equations the above type.
