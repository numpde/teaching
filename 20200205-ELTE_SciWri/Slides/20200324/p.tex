			The most appropriate physiological signals to develop simplified as well as accurate screening tests for obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) remain unknown. This study aimed at assessing whether joint analysis of at-home oximetry and airflow recordings by means of machine-learning algorithms leads to a significant diagnostic performance increase compared to single-channel approaches.

			Overall performance of the dual-channel approach (kappa: 0.71; 4-class accuracy: 81.3\%) significantly outperformed individual oximetry (kappa: 0.61; 4-class accuracy: 75.0\%) and airflow (kappa: 0.42; 4-class accuracy: 61.5\%).

			According to our findings, oximetry alone was able to reach notably high accuracy, particularly to confirm severe cases of the disease. Nevertheless, oximetry and airflow showed high complementarity leading to a remarkable performance increase compared to single-channel approaches.

			All recordings, both ${Sp O_2}$ and airflow, with a total recording time <4 h after pre-processing were discarded due to insufficient data for accurate estimation of the AHI from a single/dual-channel approach [6].

			Additionally, in order to avoid dependence on a particular training dataset, a bootstrapping approach was implemented.

			Under a dual-channel approach, variables within the joint optimum feature subset were different compared with features selected in each single-channel approach, particularly airflow-derived variables (Fig.~2).

			Accordingly, the performance of the dual-channel approach significantly outperformed individual $Sp O_2$ and airflow. AUC of $SVM_{{Sp O_2} + AF}$ model was significantly higher (p < 0.01) for all diagnostic thresholds. Moreover, in contrast to single-channel approaches, balanced sensitivity-specificity pairs were always obtained.

			Using a less conservative approach, with patients showing an estimated AHI $\geq$ 15 events/h directly referred for treatment since 100\% of patients categorised as moderate-severe OSA had at least mild OSA with symptoms (71 out of 77 actually had moderate or severe OSA, while 6 out of 77 had mild OSA), the number of PSGs potentially avoidable would increase up to 89.6\%.

		\begin{quote}
			Our proposal is a robust approach without significantly increasing the complexity and intrusiveness of portable monitoring. Indeed, commercial portable devices for simultaneous measurement of oximetry an airflow already exist, such as the widely known ARES and ApneaLink.

	}
	
	\only<14>{
		\begin{quote}
			This study provides significant evidence on the superiority of a dual-channel approach in the framework of unattended abbreviated monitoring for OSA screening.
